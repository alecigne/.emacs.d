This is my Emacs configuration, compatible with Emacs 29+. It is part
of my [[https://github.com/alecigne/dotfiles][dotfiles]] as a Git submodule.

It uses John Wiegley's [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] (part of Emacs 29) to make things:

- Neatly organized :: Everything is grouped by package. I also use
  [[https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine][outshine]] to organize code by sections.

- Readable :: =use-package= offers a large choice of expressive
  keywords.

- Self-installable :: All Emacs packages are downloaded automatically
  when I first start Emacs on a new environment.

  Thanks to =use-package='s =:vc= keyword, packages can even be
  fetched directly from source.

* Structure

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][early-init.el]] is loaded. It contains a few specific customizations
  that can take effect before the normal init process begins.

- =init.el= loads [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][package.el]], add a few tweaks to =use-package= and
  then loads my personal config files located in =./lisp/alc/=:

  + =alc-main.el= -- my main config.

  + =alc-org.el= -- my Org-mode config.

  + =alc-work.el= -- my work config (not loaded by default).

* Local configuration

I usually add a short configuration (=alc-local.el= -- not included on
any public branch) on each machine for local customizations. For
example, the =org-agenda-files= variable will mix different Org
projects that depend on the machine I am working on. This way, I can
separate Org projects at the file level but still mix tasks and events
in the agenda to get a clear picture of my day. I then filter
everything by context to avoid distraction.

* About literate Emacs configurations

I am not a fan of literate Emacs configurations (yeah, I hate
them). This one used to be such a "literate config" based on a network
of [[https://www.orgmode.org/][Org file]], but I switched for the sake of simplicity. [[https://github.com/alecigne/.emacs.d/tree/faa6d3727074f9fce746fb9653a9b4242eedce6e][Browse the
last commit]] of that Org config if you're interested, or check the
+way too+ numerous literate configs out there.
